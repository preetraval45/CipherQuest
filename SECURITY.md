# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the CipherQuest application to ensure data protection, secure communication, and defense against common web vulnerabilities.

## Security Headers

### Backend (Flask)
The Flask application implements the following security headers:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional XSS protection for older browsers
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information in requests
- **Permissions Policy**: Restricts access to sensitive browser features

### Frontend (Nginx)
The Nginx server implements additional security headers:

- **Server Information Removal**: Hides server version information
- **Hidden File Protection**: Denies access to hidden files and backup files
- **Enhanced CSP**: Stricter content security policy for production

## Environment Variables

### Required Environment Variables
All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=cipherquest_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password_here

# Flask Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production-minimum-32-characters
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-change-this-in-production-minimum-32-characters

# Security Configuration
BCRYPT_LOG_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60

# CORS Configuration
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://yourdomain.com
CORS_METHODS=GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,OPTIONS
CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS=Content-Type,Authorization,X-Requested-With
```

### Environment Variable Validation
The application validates required environment variables on startup and provides clear error messages if any are missing.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Configuration
- Secure token generation with configurable expiration
- Access and refresh token separation
- Token location restricted to headers only
- Bearer token authentication

### Password Security
- Bcrypt hashing with configurable rounds (default: 12)
- Password strength validation
- Protection against common weak passwords
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## Rate Limiting

### Implementation
- Global rate limiting: 200 requests per day, 50 per hour
- Configurable per-endpoint limits
- IP-based and user-based rate limiting
- Graceful handling of rate limit exceeded errors

## CORS Configuration

### Security Settings
- Restricted origins (configurable via environment variables)
- Limited HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS)
- Controlled headers (Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With)
- Credentials support enabled

## Database Security

### Connection Security
- Environment variable-based configuration
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secure connection strings
- Input validation and sanitization

### SQL Injection Prevention
- SQLAlchemy ORM usage
- Parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Prepared statements

## API Security

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive input validation for all endpoints
- Data sanitization
- Type checking and validation
- SQL injection prevention

### Error Handling
- Generic error messages in production
- Detailed logging for debugging
- No sensitive information in error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Docker Security

### Container Security
- Non-root user execution (where possible)
- Minimal base images
- Security updates
- Environment variable usage for secrets

### Network Security
- Isolated Docker networks
- Port exposure minimization
- Internal service communication

## Development vs Production

### Development Environment
- Less strict CSP for development convenience
- Debug mode enabled
- Detailed error messages
- SQL query logging

### Production Environment
- Strict CSP policy
- Debug mode disabled
- Generic error messages
- Minimal logging
- HTTPS enforcement

## Security Best Practices

### Code Security
1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets are loaded from environment variables
2. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **Output Encoding**: All outputs are properly encoded to prevent XSS
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling without information leakage
5. **Logging**: Secure logging practices without sensitive data exposure

### Deployment Security
1. **Environment Variables**: Use secure environment variable management
2. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting
5. **Backup Security**: Secure backup procedures

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables are set
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] HTTPS is configured
- [ ] Security headers are enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Database credentials are secure
- [ ] Logging is configured for security events

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
- [ ] Backup security configurations
- [ ] Test security measures

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures
1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve

### Contact Information
For security issues, please contact the development team through the appropriate channels.

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- User data encryption at rest
- Secure transmission protocols
- Access control and authentication
- Audit logging

### Privacy
- Minimal data collection
- User consent mechanisms
- Data retention policies
- Right to deletion
